## About

The COFFFEE Shop was a weekend project mainly created to expand my understanding of the Next.js framework as well as explore the viability of using AI image and text generation tools in the design process. All images and text on the site were generated using OpenAi’s [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and their corresponding [text api](https://beta.openai.com/). These assets were included on the site as is - no alterations or edits were made outside of OpenAi’s platform.

Overall, I was incredible impressed with what the OpenAi team has come up with and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to incorporate and refine a style for a site / brand by using AI generated assets.

## Design

I make all my Figma mocks publicly available for those who are curious about my design process or just want to tinker with the layout in their own way. For the COFFFEE Shop those mocks can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/FjfhOf31XhGdNPmoGRsmX9/COFFFEE-SHOP?node-id=0%3A3). Additionally, all assets on the site are available in the [assets folder](./public/assets/) of this repo.
